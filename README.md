**Financial Market Analysis**: Sentiment analysis is used to gauge the mood of investors based on news articles, financial reports, or social media chatter. Positive or negative sentiments can be predictive indicators of stock price movements.

**Customer Support**: Businesses can prioritize customer support tickets based on sentiment. For instance, if a message is classified as negative, it might be escalated to higher-tier support or flagged for immediate attention.
